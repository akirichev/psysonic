 * playing whatever cold-started before the undo — so we need a full
 * `audio_play` (+ optional `audio_seek` to the snapshot position) to
 * line the audible playback back up with the restored UI state.
 *
 * Captures the play-generation at start so a later concurrent `playTrack`
 * (e.g. user clicks another track) invalidates the seek/pause follow-up
 * without clobbering the new engine state.
